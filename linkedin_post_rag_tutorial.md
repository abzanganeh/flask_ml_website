# LinkedIn Post: RAG Tutorial

## Version 1: Standard (Recommended)

---

🚀 **Just launched a comprehensive RAG tutorial!** 

Tired of LLMs hallucinating or giving outdated answers? Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solves this by combining information retrieval with language generation.

**What you'll learn:**
✅ Introduction to RAG architecture & why it matters
✅ Text embeddings & vector representations
✅ Document processing & chunking strategies
✅ Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, FAISS)
✅ Retrieval strategies (dense, sparse, hybrid)
✅ Building end-to-end RAG systems
✅ Production deployment & optimization

**Why RAG?**
• Reduces hallucination by grounding responses in real data
• Provides up-to-date information without retraining
• Enables domain-specific knowledge without fine-tuning
• Allows source attribution and transparency

Perfect for ML engineers, data scientists, and anyone building AI applications that need accurate, factual responses.

## Version 3: Technical Deep-Dive

---

📚 **New Tutorial: Building Production RAG Systems**

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the standard approach for grounding LLM responses in external knowledge. I've created a comprehensive 7-chapter tutorial covering everything from theory to production deployment.

**Technical Coverage:**
• Mathematical foundations: P(y|q) = P(y|q, Retrieve(q,D))
• Embedding models: Sentence-BERT, OpenAI embeddings, dense vs sparse
• Vector databases: HNSW indexing, similarity search algorithms
• Retrieval strategies: BM25, cosine similarity, hybrid approaches
• Advanced techniques: query expansion, multi-step retrieval, re-ranking
• Production considerations: monitoring, error handling, scaling

**Key Topics:**
- Document processing & semantic chunking
- Vector database selection (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, FAISS)
- Context assembly & prompt engineering
- Evaluation metrics (Precision@k, Recall@k)
- Performance optimization

Each chapter includes code implementations, mathematical formulations, and interview-style questions.
