                <div class="about-intro">
                    <p>I'm a software engineer with over a decade of experience in automation systems, infrastructure design, and full-stack development. In recent years, I've transitioned into machine learning and GenAI through structured training and hands-on project work.</p>
                    
                    <p>I completed Interview Kickstart's AIML Software Engineering Program, where I focused on supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers), and LLM applications. My current interests include prompt engineering, NLP pipelines, and agentic AI systems.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've built full-stack ML applications, deployed models via Flask, and engineered validation and monitoring systems for ML-driven platforms. My background in automation gives me a strong foundation in reproducibility, deployment, and system reliability.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm actively building a portfolio of ML and GenAI projects and preparing for roles in Applied ML Research, ML Ops, and Prompt Engineering.</p>
